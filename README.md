## What is a ledger?

The main idea of a ledger is to store a history of changes, in other words, we assume that we shouldn't replace anything, just create. Each entry in a ledger usually contains the type of transaction, value, sender, recipient and the time stamp, guaranteeing the immutability of the data, since it cannot be altered or removed.

## Historical context

Ledgers have been around for a long time, starting back in ancient civilizations, where they recorded stock, transactions and assets on clay tablets.

In the Middle Ages, when trade became stronger, ledgers had to become more complex and formal, being organized on behalf of and kept by merchants and bankers.

In the last century, with the advent of the computer, ledgers began to be digitized, allowing them to operate more efficiently, storing and processing on a large scale, and mainly reducing the risk of human error.

Today the concept is still used and implemented in programming, guaranteeing the security, reliability and traceability of data. Ledgers are widely used in corporate banking environments and even in blockchains.
